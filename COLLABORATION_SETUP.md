## üöÄ How to Test Real-Time Collaboration

### Basic Collaboration Testing
1. **Start both servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start PartyKit server
   npm run party:dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Start Next.js server  
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your editor**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/editor` for a new document
   - Or go to `http://localhost:3000/editor/[existing-document-id]`

3. **Test multi-user collaboration**:
   - **Open the same document URL in multiple browser windows/tabs**
   - **Use different user accounts** (sign in with different Clerk accounts)
   - **Or use incognito mode** for a second user session

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### If Collaborative Cursors Aren't Visible:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for awareness setup logs and any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Multiple Users**: Ensure you're testing with different authenticated users
3. **Check User Awareness**: Look for console logs showing user awareness state changes
4. **Inspect DOM Elements**: Use browser dev tools to check for `.cm-yCursor` elements
5. **CSS Conflicts**: Ensure custom styles aren't overriding collaborative cursor styles

### If Real-Time Sync Isn't Working:
1. **PartyKit Server Status**: Verify PartyKit is running on `http://localhost:1999`
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Check browser Network tab for WebSocket connections
3. **Environment Variables**: Confirm `.env.local` has correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST`
4. **Document ID**: Ensure both users are accessing the exact same document URL
5. **Firewall/Network**: Check if firewall is blocking WebSocket connections

### If Users Can't See Each Other:
1. **Authentication**: Make sure both users are signed in with different Clerk accounts
2. **User Data**: Verify user firstName or email is available in Clerk user object
3. **Awareness States**: Check console for awareness state updates when users join
4. **Browser Sessions**: Try using incognito mode for the second user
5. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and localStorage if issues persist
